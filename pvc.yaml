  # selector: # matching between PV and PVC, normally don't need it
  #   matchLabels:
  #     release: "stable"  # matchLabels - the volume must have a label with this value 
  #   matchExpressions:
  #     - {key: environment, operator: In, values: [dev]}

# matchExpressions - a list of requirements made by specifying key, list of values, and operator that relates the key and values. Valid operators include In, NotIn, Exists, and DoesNotExist.
# All of the requirements, from both matchLabels and matchExpressions, are ANDed together â€“ they must all be satisfied in order to match.
